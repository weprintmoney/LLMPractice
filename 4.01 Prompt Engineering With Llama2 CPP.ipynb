The additional charges to fix its constant glitches and defects drained my wallet even more. I spend 275 $ to get a new battery. The final straw was when the phone's camera malfunctioned, and the repair cost was astronomical. I demand a full refund and an apology for this abysmal product. Returning it would be a relief, as this phone has become nothing but a money pit. Beware, fellow buyers!”\n","\n","\n","Review-2:\n","“I am beyond furious with my purchase of the ZetaPhone Z5! The $1200 price tag should have guaranteed excellence, but it was a complete rip-off. The phone constantly froze, crashed, and had terrible reception. I had to spend an extra $150 for software repairs, and it still didn't improve. The worst part was the camera malfunctioned just after a week, and the repair cost was an outrageous $300! I demand a full refund and an apology for this disgraceful excuse for a phone. Save yourself the trouble and avoid the ZetaPhone Z5 at all costs!”\n","\n","Review-3:\n","“Purchasing the TechPro X8 for $900 was the biggest mistake of my life. I expected a top-notch device, but it was a complete disaster. The phone's battery drained within hours, even with minimal usage. On top of that, the screen randomly flickered, and the touch functionality was erratic. I had to shell out an additional $200 for a replacement battery, but it barely made a difference. To add insult to injury, the camera failed within a month, and the repair cost was an absurd $400! I urge everyone to avoid the TechPro X8—pure frustration and utter waste of money.”\n","\n","Review-4:\n","“This phone left me seething with anger and regret. Spending $1400 on this phone was an outright scam. The device was riddled with issues from day one. The software glitches made it virtually unusable, and the constant crashes were infuriating. To add insult to injury, the charging port became faulty within two weeks, costing me an extra $100 for repairs. And guess what?
