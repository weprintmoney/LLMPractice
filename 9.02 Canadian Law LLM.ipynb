        "The goal of this assignment is to explore advanced applications of large language models in the legal domain. We will implement the LLaMA3 GGUF model with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, using a dataset consisting of the consolidated acts and regulations of Canada. This implementation aims to leverage the rich contextual understanding of the LLaMA3 model with the retrieval capabilities of RAG to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated responses in legal contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Background\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The model we will be downloading from Hugging Face is a **5-bit quantized version of the Llama 3 8B chat model**, made available by NousResearch. The model is made available in the **GGUF format** - a new format introduced by the Llama CPP team and a replacement for the earlier GGML format, with advantages such as better tokenization and support for special tokens. Llama is short for **L**arge **LA**nguage Model **M**eta **A**I. https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF\n",
        "\n",
        "*   RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) combines a powerful transformer-based language model with a retrieval system, allowing the model to pull in relevant external information during the generation process. This combination is particularly potent for domains like law where precedent and specific details are crucial. https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/a-cheat-sheet-and-some-recipes-for-building-advanced-rag-803a9d94c41b\n",

        "\n",
        "*   LangChain equips us with advanced text generation techniques, enabling our query engine to generate meaningful and context-aware responses. https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/get_started/introduction\n",

        "### Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The legal dataset provided includes the consolidated acts and regulations of Canada in both English and French as a collection of XML documents which are regularly updated in the linked repository. This dataset will serve as the source for the retrieval component of the RAG, enabling the LLaMA3 model to access and utilize specific legal information when generating responses. https://github.com/justicecanada/laws-lois-xml"
